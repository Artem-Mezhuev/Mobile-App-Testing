As part of the study of the Mobile App Testing module, I completed the following task :

- Your objective: to fully test the mobile app on the Android platform. For testing purposes you can use both the real device and emulator (Android Studio). The installation file itself you will find here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kqWnm6z293ETG0MdKTjrsrWd7WHz/?viewusp=sharing

Task:

- Write a checklist to test all the features of the application and download the Google Table. Basic checklists for general checks are also available online
- For one of any module (it is better to take a module to create a task), which you determine, write a test set with the cases in the QASE system or TestIT (of your choice) in the Mobile App Testing set
- Based on written documentation, file defect reports into YouTrack.
